This is a reimplementation of ActiveRecord, a part of Ruby on Rails governing interaction with a remote database.

It includes implementations of several ActiveRecord::Base features, including mass assignment (as governed by 
attr_accessible) and object-oriented database interaction (including #find, #create, #update, #save, and #where methods,
as well as associations).
